<h2 align="center">HiðŸ‘‹, I'm Ameer Adel Welcome to my profile. Here you will find a short story about my career summary, I hope you enjoy it :)
  
</h2>

<h4 align="center">
Since I was thirteen years old, I have had a passion for everything related to technology, from mobiles to computers. My father, may God have mercy on him, always encouraged me to develop this passion and turn it into a business. I started working in web development when he asked me if I could make some modifications and add banner ads to the website of the travel and tourism company he was managing at this time. That's when I started learning HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Until I have completed all the required modifications.After that I started working on a personal website using Www.Hotelscombined.com Affiliate program. And I was making a good income per month through commission. Then I worked on designing and managing many websites and vbulletin forums which was so popular at this time. After that I decided to enter the Faculty of Computer Science and studied Java as a primary language, and my graduation project was an Android application that works to restore real social interaction instead of social media. After graduation, I finished my military service and started working as a Wordpress developer for 5 months in this time I developed 9 Wordpress websites for different companies, and then I moved to mail marketing using I-response and SMTPs, after one and half a year I decided to go back working on mobile applications, but this time as an iOS Developer using Swift and swiftUi. recently I have started paul hudson swift and swiftUI 100 days tutorials on www.hackingwithswift.com , and I wish i will finish it soon and start my new career chapter as an iOS developer. 

I'm pleased you have spent some of your precious time reading my career summary, wish you all the best in your professional and social life.</h4>
